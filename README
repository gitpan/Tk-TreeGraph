Tk::TreeGraph is a Canvas specialized to draw trees on a Canvas using
arrows and nodes. A node is simply some text imbedded in a rectangular
shape.

TreeGraph is able to draw the following items:

- node: some text in a rectangular shape.
- direct arrow: an arrow to go from one node to the following one.
- slanted arrow: an arrow to make a new branch 
- shortcuts arrow: an arrow to represent a shortcut between 2 nodes from
  different branches.

TreeGraph is now in released status.

Starting from version 1.007, all coordinates are handled by the
object.  Hence drawing the tree is much simpler.

Starting from version 1.008, you don't need to draw the direct and
slanted arrows yourself, the object will do it for you when you add a
node.

Hence drawing the tree is even more simple.

Starting from version 1.013, the drawing is more compact.

Starting from version 1.016 TreeGraph no longer messes with
-scrollregion. When a Scrolled TreeGraph is used, the -scrollregion
will have to be modified by the user.

Starting from version 1.023, you can modify a node color or text or
make a node flash.

Suggested DSLI line in the Ptk module list:

Tk::TreeGraph RdpO  Widget to draw a tree in a Canvas    DDUMONT


You can run all test with argument '1' to run the test in interactive mode
with traces. (i.e "perl t/only_node.t 1").

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Thanks to Ralf Valerien for the bug fix and the spline shortcut arrow.
