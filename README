Tk::TreeGraph is a Canvas specialized to draw trees on a Canvas using
arrows and nodes. A node is simply some text imbedded in a rectangular shape.

TreeGraph is able to draw the following items:

- node: some text in a rectangular shape.
- direct arrow: an arrow to go from one node to the following one.
- slanted arrow: an arrow to make a new branch 
- shortcuts arrow: an arrow to represent a shortcut between 2 nodes from
  different branches.

Starting from version 1.007, all coordinates are handled by the object.
Hence drawing the tree is much simpler.

Suggested DSLI line in the Ptk module list:

Tk::TreeGraph bdpO  Widget to draw a tree in a Canvas    DDUMONT


See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
